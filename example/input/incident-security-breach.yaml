  severity: "1 - Critical"

  category: "Security"
  subcategory: "Account Takeover / Credential Stuffing"

  environment: "Production"
  region: "us-east-1, eu-west-1"
  business_impact: >
    Automated credential stuffing attack targeting the /auth/login endpoint. 3.2 million
    login attempts in the past 45 minutes from ~180,000 distinct IPs (botnet). Confirmed
    successful account compromises: 1,847 customer accounts. Attacker activity post-login
    includes PII lookups (name, address, last 4 of payment card) and initiation of password
    reset flows. Data protection regulatory notification obligations may apply within 72
    hours (GDPR Art. 33, CCPA). Legitimate user logins are also degraded — auth service
    p99 latency at 8,400ms (normal: 180ms). Customer trust and regulatory exposure are
    the primary risks.

  short_description: >
    Large-scale credential stuffing attack on /auth/login detected at 03:15 UTC.
    Auth failure rate 500% above baseline. 1,847 accounts confirmed compromised.
    PII accessed post-login. Botnet sourced from ~180K IPs — WAF rate limiting
    partially applied but insufficient.
  description: |
    At 03:15:22 UTC Splunk SIEM rule CRED_STUFFING_01 fired: "Authentication failure rate
    exceeds 500% of 7-day rolling baseline for >5 consecutive minutes".

    Attack profile (data from WAF + auth-service logs):
    - Attack start: ~02:28 UTC (pre-alert ramp-up phase)
    - Peak rate: 71,000 login attempts/minute at 03:10 UTC
    - Source IPs: 179,843 unique IPs across 94 countries (residential proxies + VPS clusters)
    - User-Agent rotation detected: cycling through 400+ browser user-agents
    - Credential list: combolist format (email:password) — likely sourced from prior
      breach data (HaveIBeenPwned exposure matches patterns)
    - Attack vectors: /auth/login (REST), /oauth/token (OAuth password grant)

    Account compromise analysis (auth-service audit log + downstream access):
    - 1,847 successful logins from attacker IPs confirmed via IP reputation API
    - Post-login activity: GET /api/v2/user/profile (PII: name, email, phone, address)
    - 214 accounts: GET /api/v2/payment/cards (masked card data — last 4 + expiry)
    - 63 accounts: password reset initiated from attacker session
    - 0 accounts: payment transaction completed (checkout service requires 3DS — held)

    Current mitigations applied (partial):
    - Cloudflare WAF: rate limit rule added at 03:19 UTC — 100 req/min per IP, 60s ban
    - CAPTCHA challenge added to /auth/login for IPs with >5 failures in 60s
    - WAF rule has NOT blocked /oauth/token — attack pivoted to OAuth endpoint at 03:22 UTC

    Auth service impact on legitimate users:
    - p99 login latency: 8,400ms (SLA: <500ms)
    - Login success rate for legitimate users: 61% (normal: 99.7%)

    Compromised accounts have NOT been force-logged-out or locked yet — pending IC decision.
    DLP alerts: no evidence of bulk data exfiltration to external endpoints. Cloudflare
    Firewall Analytics shows attack traffic is predominantly TCP/443.

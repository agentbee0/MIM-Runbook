  number: "INC0091245"
  title: "Multi-Region Network Outage — BGP Route Withdrawal Causing Global Connectivity Loss"
  severity: "1 - Critical"
  priority: "1 - Critical"
  state: "In Progress"
  category: "Network"
  subcategory: "BGP / Routing"
  affected_service: "Global Application Network — All Customer-Facing Traffic"
  affected_ci: "core-router-edge-01"
  environment: "Production"
  region: "global (us-east-1, eu-west-1, ap-southeast-1)"
  business_impact: >
    All inbound customer traffic to production services is failing. 100% packet loss from
    external clients to all three production regions. Estimated 45,000 active sessions
    dropped. Revenue impact ~$120K/minute. B2B SLA breach imminent for Tier-1 enterprise
    customers. Brand and regulatory exposure if outage exceeds 30 minutes.

  short_description: >
    BGP sessions dropped on core-router-edge-01 at 09:12 UTC. All three upstream transit
    providers (Cogent, Zayo, Lumen) withdrew routes simultaneously. Customer-facing
    services globally unreachable.
  description: |
    At 09:12:37 UTC PagerDuty fired a P1 alert: "BGP peer down — 3 peers on core-router-edge-01".
    Within 90 seconds all three transit BGP sessions (AS174 Cogent, AS6461 Zayo, AS3356 Lumen)
    dropped. The autonomous system (AS64512) lost all upstream route advertisements.

    Symptoms observed:
    - 100% external packet loss to all production VIPs (load balancers, CDN origins)
    - Internal east-west traffic between services is unaffected
    - No hardware or interface errors on core-router-edge-01
    - BGP daemon (FRRouTing 9.1) shows all peers in IDLE state
    - syslog on core-router-edge-01 shows: "NOTIFICATION received from peer AS174: HOLD TIMER EXPIRED"
    - Change freeze window is NOT active; a BGP community configuration change was pushed
      by network-eng at 09:05 UTC (7 minutes before the outage) — change ticket CHG0034891

    Possible cause: misconfigured BGP route-map applying a REJECT ALL policy to outbound
    advertisements or modifying MED/LOCAL_PREF values that triggered peer resets.

    No DDoS signature detected. CDN edge nodes (Cloudflare) show normal traffic in their
    scrubbing centres — issue is origin-side.

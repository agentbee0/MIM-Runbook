| Title | Multi-Region Network Outage — BGP Route Withdrawal Causing Global Connectivity Loss |
| Severity | 1 - Critical |
| Priority | 1 - Critical |
| State | In Progress |
| Affected Service | Global Application Network — All Customer-Facing Traffic |
| Affected CI / Resource | core-router-edge-01 |
| Environment | Production (global (us-east-1, eu-west-1, ap-southeast-1)) |
| Category | Network / BGP / Routing |
| Assigned To | Network Operations |
| Assignment Group | NOC — Tier 3 Network Engineering |
| Reported By | PagerDuty Auto-Alert (BGP peer down — 3 simultaneous peers) |
| Opened At | 2026-02-26 09:14:00 UTC |
| Detected At | 2026-02-26 09:12:37 UTC |
| Change Related | YES — investigate recent changes |
| Related Incident | None |

**Business Impact**

All inbound customer traffic to production services is failing. 100% packet loss from external clients to all three production regions. Estimated 45,000 active sessions dropped. Revenue impact ~$120K/minute. B2B SLA breach imminent for Tier-1 enterprise customers. Brand and regulatory exposure if outage exceeds 30 minutes.


> 🔴 **CRITICAL**: ⚠️  This is a Severity 1 - Critical incident. Every minute of delay costs revenue and customer trust. Follow this runbook from top to bottom without skipping steps.

**Incident Description**

At 09:12:37 UTC PagerDuty fired a P1 alert: "BGP peer down — 3 peers on core-router-edge-01".
Within 90 seconds all three transit BGP sessions (AS174 Cogent, AS6461 Zayo, AS3356 Lumen)
dropped. The autonomous system (AS64512) lost all upstream route advertisements.

Symptoms observed:
- 100% external packet loss to all production VIPs (load balancers, CDN origins)
- Internal east-west traffic between services is unaffected
- No hardware or interface errors on core-router-edge-01
- BGP daemon (FRRouTing 9.1) shows all peers in IDLE state
- syslog on core-router-edge-01 shows: "NOTIFICATION received from peer AS174: HOLD TIMER EXPIRED"
- Change freeze window is NOT active; a BGP community configuration change was pushed
  by network-eng at 09:05 UTC (7 minutes before the outage) — change ticket CHG0034891

Possible cause: misconfigured BGP route-map applying a REJECT ALL policy to outbound
advertisements or modifying MED/LOCAL_PREF values that triggered peer resets.

No DDoS signature detected. CDN edge nodes (Cloudflare) show normal traffic in their
scrubbing centres — issue is origin-side.

## 2. Immediate Triage Checklist (First 5 Minutes)

> 🟡 **WARNING**: Complete all steps in this section within 5 minutes of picking up the alert. Do not investigate root cause yet — your goal is to confirm, assess, and mobilise.

**Step 1:** **T+0 — Confirm the alert is genuine.**

Check that core-router-edge-01 is actually unreachable or degraded. Do NOT assume the monitoring tool is always right — false positives happen.

Run: `ping core-router-edge-01` and `curl -I https://core-router-edge-01/health` (or equivalent health endpoint)

If the CI responds normally → the alert may be a false positive. Acknowledge in monitoring and add a note to INC0091245 before standing down.

**Step 2:** **T+1 — Check the monitoring dashboard.**

Open the primary monitoring dashboard for 'Global Application Network — All Customer-Facing Traffic'. Look for:
• Red/critical alerts in the last 15 minutes
• Any correlated alerts (DB + App + Network firing together suggests a larger blast radius)
• Comparison to baseline from same time yesterday

**Step 3:** **T+2 — Assess blast radius.**

Answer these questions before joining the bridge:
• How many users/customers are affected? (check active sessions, error rates)
• What downstream services depend on 'core-router-edge-01'?
• Is this isolated to one region (global (us-east-1, eu-west-1, ap-southeast-1)) or multi-region?
• Are any other Sev1/Sev2 incidents currently open that could be related?

**Step 4:** **T+3 — Open the incident Slack channel.**

Create channel: #incinc0091245

Paste this message as the first post:

## 4. Diagnosis & Investigation Steps

**Owner**: Fatima Al-Hassan (@fatima.alhassan)

**Goal of this section**: Understand WHAT is broken and WHY, so you can take the right containment action. Work through steps in order. Document every finding in the Slack channel as you go.

> 🔵 **INFO**: For every check below: state what you expected vs. what you found. 'Good' means the result matches expected baseline. 'Bad' means it deviates and needs investigation.

**Step 1:** **Confirm reachability from multiple vantage points.**

```
# From your workstation:
ping -c 5 core-router-edge-01
traceroute core-router-edge-01
mtr --report core-router-edge-01

# From another host in the same region:
ssh jump-host "ping -c 5 core-router-edge-01"
ssh jump-host "curl -o /dev/null -s -w '%{http_code}' https://core-router-edge-01/health"
```

✅ **Good**: Reachable from all vantage points, <10ms latency
❌ **Bad**: Unreachable from some/all → packet loss indicates routing or firewall issue
⚡ **Decision**: If reachable from internal but not external → check firewall/CDN (Step 3)

**Step 2:** **Check routing tables and BGP status.**

```
# Check routing:
ip route show
netstat -rn

# For BGP environments (check with network team):
show ip bgp summary   # (on router/switch)
show ip route bgp

# Check DNS resolution:
dig core-router-edge-01
nslookup core-router-edge-01
```

✅ **Good**: Correct routes present, BGP peers UP, DNS resolves correctly
❌ **Bad**: Missing routes, BGP peer DOWN, DNS returns wrong IP → network team escalation required

**Step 3:** **Check firewall and security group rules.**

Verify no rule was recently changed that blocks traffic to/from core-router-edge-01:
```
# Linux firewall:
sudo iptables -L -n -v | head -50
sudo firewall-cmd --list-all

# AWS Security Groups (if applicable):
aws ec2 describe-security-groups --group-ids [SG_ID] --query 'SecurityGroups[*].IpPermissions'
```

⚡ **Decision**: If a rule was changed in last 4 hours → revert the change (Section 5)

**Step 4:** **Check CDN and load balancer health.**

Verify CDN edge nodes are serving traffic and not returning errors:
```
curl -I -H "Host: Global Application Network — All Customer-Facing Traffic" https://[CDN_EDGE_IP]/health
curl -I https://Global Application Network — All Customer-Facing Traffic/health
```

Check load balancer health page in your cloud console or management tool. Look for:
• Backend instance health checks failing
• SSL certificate expiry (check expiry date)
• Origin connection errors

**What did network diagnosis reveal?**

- If **BGP peer down or routing change** → Section 5, Step 1: Revert routing change or failover to backup link
- If **Firewall rule blocking traffic** → Section 5, Step 2: Revert firewall rule change
- If **DNS misconfiguration** → Section 5, Step 3: Fix DNS record and force propagation
- If **CDN/Load balancer issue** → Section 5, Step 4: Bypass CDN or failover load balancer
- If **Unresolved — no root cause found** → Escalate to Senior Network Engineer and vendor (Section 6)

### Root Cause Hypothesis Log

Before moving to containment, post your working hypothesis in the Slack channel:

```
We believe the root cause is: [YOUR HYPOTHESIS]
Evidence supporting this: [LIST EVIDENCE]
Evidence against this: [CONTRADICTORY FINDINGS]
Confidence level: High / Medium / Low
Recommended next action: [SPECIFIC ACTION]
```

---
## 5. Containment & Mitigation Actions

**Owner**: Fatima Al-Hassan

**Rule**: Before executing any containment action, announce it in inc0091245 Slack channel:
> "About to execute: [ACTION]. Expected impact: [IMPACT]. Rollback plan: [ROLLBACK]. Approvals: [NAMES]"

For **irreversible or high-risk actions**, obtain verbal approval from the Incident Commander and document it in the Slack channel.

> 🟡 **WARNING**: CAB Emergency Approval: Some actions below (marked ⚠️ CAB) require Change Advisory Board emergency approval. To get fast approval: (1) Call the CAB emergency line at [CAB_PHONE], (2) State incident number and requested change, (3) Get verbal approval from the CAB chair, (4) Log the change in your ITSM tool immediately after.

**Step 1:** **Revert the routing change / re-advertise the route.**

⚠️ CAB required.

```
# Rollback network change via your network management tool
# Or re-advertise the withdrawn BGP route
# Specific commands depend on your network vendor — contact your network team
```

**Validate**: Run `traceroute core-router-edge-01` from multiple vantage points.

**Step 2:** **Revert firewall rule change.**

```
# Linux iptables — remove the blocking rule:
sudo iptables -D INPUT -s [BLOCKED_IP] -j DROP

# AWS Security Group — restore the inbound rule:
aws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress \
  --group-id [SG_ID] \
  --protocol tcp --port [PORT] --cidr [CIDR]
```

**Step 3:** **Bypass CDN and route traffic directly to origin.**

Update DNS to point directly to origin load balancer (bypasses CDN caching and edge issues):
```
# AWS Route 53 — update record to point to ALB:
aws route53 change-resource-record-sets --hosted-zone-id [ZONE_ID] \
  --change-batch file://failover-dns.json
```

**Monitor**: DNS propagation takes 1-5 minutes. Monitor via: `watch -n 10 "dig core-router-edge-01 @8.8.8.8"`

**Rollback**: Revert DNS record back to CDN CNAME once CDN issue is resolved.

## 7. Resolution & Validation

**Owner**: Daniel Ortega

Before declaring the incident resolved, ALL of the following criteria must be met. Do not close the incident if any item is failing or unclear.

### Resolution Criteria Checklist

- [ ] Health endpoint returns 200 OK: `curl -I https://core-router-edge-01/health`

- [ ] Synthetic monitor for 'Global Application Network — All Customer-Facing Traffic' is GREEN (check your monitoring tool)

- [ ] Error rate has returned to pre-incident baseline (check APM dashboard)

- [ ] P99 latency has returned to normal range

- [ ] Customer-facing checkout / primary user flow is functioning end-to-end

- [ ] Alerting rules are no longer firing

- [ ] On-call engineer has monitored for 10 minutes with no re-trigger

- [ ] Business stakeholder (Customer Impact Lead) has confirmed no open customer complaints

### Severity Downgrade Criteria

| Condition | Action |
| --- | --- |
| All health checks pass, no customer impact, stable for 10 min | Downgrade to Sev2 and continue monitoring |
| Partial restoration (some customers still affected) | Downgrade to Sev2, keep bridge open, continue investigation |
| Workaround in place (not fully resolved) | Downgrade to Sev2, open follow-up task for permanent fix |

### Closing the Bridge

**Step 1:** Announce in the Zoom bridge: "Service is restored. All health checks passing. We are closing the bridge. Thank you everyone."

**Step 2:** Post in Slack channel #inc0091245:
